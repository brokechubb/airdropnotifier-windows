## Building a Standalone Executable

You can create a self-contained executable that doesn't require Python to be installed on the target machine.

### Prerequisites for Building
- Windows OS
- Python 3.7+ installed
- All dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Build Process

1. **Configure your Discord token** in `config.json` before building
2. **Run the build script**:
```bash
build_exe.bat
```

This will:
- Create a build virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies including PyInstaller
- Clean previous build artifacts
- Generate `DiscordAirdropNotifier.exe` in the `dist/` folder

### Build Output

- **Executable**: `dist/DiscordAirdropNotifier.exe` (~50-80MB)
- **Self-contained**: Includes Python, all libraries, and the audio file
- **No installation required**: Can run on any Windows machine
- **Portable**: Single file that can be distributed

### Important Notes for Executable

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: The Discord token will be embedded in the executable. Never distribute an executable with your personal token.

üìã **Config File**: The executable will look for `config.json` in the same directory. If not found, it will create one from the bundled template.

üîß **Build Requirements**:
- Building requires ~200MB of disk space
- Build process takes 2-5 minutes depending on your system
- Antivirus software may interfere with PyInstaller (temporarily disable if needed)

üìÅ **Distribution**: You only need to distribute the `.exe` file - the audio files and all dependencies are bundled inside.

## Audio Configuration

The notifier includes a bundled `cash-register-05.wav` file in the `audio/` directory. If this file is not found, it automatically falls back to Windows system notification sounds.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

The bot detects airdrops for: BTC, LTC, DOGE, EOS, TRX, USDT, ETH, XNO, BCH, USDC, SHIB, MATIC, XRP, XLM, SOL

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This uses a regular Discord user account (not a bot token) which may violate Discord's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.**

The application is designed to monitor only (never posts messages) but Discord's automation policies still apply.
